### 1. MALMM: Multi-Agent Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Robotic Manipulation
MALMM (Multi-Agent Large Language Model for Manipulation) represents the most advanced multi-agent LLM framework specifically designed for robotics. This system distributes planning across three specialized agents: high-level planning, low-level control, and supervisor agents. MALMM addresses key limitations of single-agent approaches by incorporating environment observations after each step, enabling adaptive re-planning and intermediate failure recovery. The framework demonstrates superior performance in RLBench simulations and real-world Franka robot arm experiments.

### 2. Robot Simulation Integration
Robot Simulation Integration
Gazebo and ROS Integration has been extensively explored for LLM-robot control. Recent implementations demonstrate successful natural language control of robots in Gazebo simulations using frameworks like ROSA (Robot Operating System Agent). These systems enable users to issue high-level commands that are translated into ROS control instructions, bridging the gap between natural language understanding and low-level robot control.
